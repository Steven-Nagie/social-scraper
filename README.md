#Social Post Scraper

This product generates statistics used by advertisers to assess influence marketers as potential clients. The app takes in a  list of post urls from facebook, instagram, and twitter. It then generates all needed data and streams it to the frontend of the app, where it is displayed in the browser. From there it can be exported to a CSV file with the press of a button. Technologies used: AngularJS, NodeJS, test driven development, the observer pattern, the module pattern and sockets. The app is currently undergoing testing by the Branded Entertainment Network.

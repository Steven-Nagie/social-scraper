#Social Post Scraper 

This product generates statistics used by advertisers to assess influence marketers as potential clients. The app takes in a  list of post urls from facebook, instagram, and twitter. It then generates all needed data and streams it to the frontend of the app where it exports the data to a csv file. Technologies used: AngularJS, NodeJS, test driven development, the observer pattern, the module pattern and sockets. The app is currently undergoing testing by the Branded Entertainment Network.

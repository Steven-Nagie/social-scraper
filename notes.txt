posts = returns a list of all their posts, including an id for the post, which we can presumably use to see likes on that post.

Posts
fields:
shares = share count of the post
  if no shares, response contains only post id

edges:
likes
  returns an array of users who have liked the post. To get a total we have to do res.data[0].length, and we have to be careful that we put the limit pretty high so we don't cut anyone off. I think the default limit is 25.
reactions
  Returns an array of users who have reacted, including a property describing their type of reaction.
comments
sharedposts
  If no shares, response is empty array
